# Barotrauma Enhanced: Campaign
This mod aims to non-disruptively add variety and more things to do. Non-disruptively means this mod won't disrupt regular gameplay, as it does not make changes to gameplay that exists without this mod. It's simply an addition that can be removed at any time*. In the end, this mod's goal is to try and stop things from becoming same-y.
