# Atlas Submarine
The Atlas is designed for two specific kinds of server: frequently-restarting sandbox rounds and serious roleplay servers.
Being so large, the submarine can accommodate over 16 players easily.

**Features**
- Balanced motion and door tracking system for security
- Well armed with a large blindspot near a critical part of the ship
- Massive amounts of resources off-the-bat for sandbox mode
- Small manned shuttle and tiny unmanned drone
- Submarine PSA system and shipwide lockdown option
- Empty spaces for plant growing or electrical trickery
- Recreation-oriented areas for roleplay purposes
- Jobs+ and Thalassophobia compatible variant (Atlas X)

**Notices**
- This mod requires EK Dockyard to work correctly. Make sure you have it installed.
- The Atlas X variant might throw errors on startup - this is to be expected if you don't have all the mods that add the different jobs. Don't worry, it's completely fine.
- Currently, the Atlas X supports Jobs+ and Thalassophobia out of the box.
