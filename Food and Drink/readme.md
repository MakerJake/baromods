# Food and Drink
Food and Drink adds hunger and thirst mechanics to Barotrauma, and a whole host of immersive and interesting foods. Made to fully function in a roleplay environment, this mod will satisfy your desire for a hunger meter.
This mod is designed for campaign, and it isn't recommended to use this in Mission or Sandbox mode.

**Features**
- 11 different foods: 11 unique, immersive, and interesting foods to keep you engaged. From the peak of luxury to basically dirt, there's a whole spectrum of foods to try.
- 4 different drinks: Kick back, relax, and enjoy some Saltbulb Juice as your hull is smashed in by mudraptors.
- Cook job: This mod adds a dedicated Cook job for high-intensity cooking gameplay (and rp)
- Agriculture: Grow crops to feed your crew, expanding on the base plant system
- Hunting: Hunt the denizens of Europa for food

**Notices**
