# Veri's Gun Mod
This is a gun mod designed explicitly for admin abuse servers. It contains, for the most part, real-life weapons with stats that mirror their real counterparts. Additionally, a lot of the weapons in this mod are exceptionally powerful, often able to instantly kill an unarmored player. This is intentional, and the weapons are intended to be used on heavily armored targets, or targets with large health pools.
