# Barotrauma Enhanced: Weapons
This mod adds various weapons in the vanilla style for late-game combat.

**Features**
- Physicorium Canister Shell: A vastly more powerful version of Canister Shells, wreaking havoc on soft targets with immense efficiency.
- Fulgurium-Laced Pulse Laser Ammo: Using the poorly-understood properties of Fulgurium, this pulse laser ammo has excellent damage output and better longevity.
